# Tank Wars Unity Project

This is a Unity game project for Tank Wars.

## Project Information

- **Unity Version**: See `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`
- **Repository Size**: ~2.8GB (Assets folder)
- **Last Updated**: See git commit history

## How to Restore/Continue Development

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already local):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tank-wars
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click "Open" or "Add"
   - Select the `tank-wars` folder
   - Unity will automatically:
     - Detect the project version
     - Reimport all assets
     - Regenerate the `Library/` folder (this will take time)
     - Restore packages from `Packages/manifest.json`

3. **Wait for Unity to finish importing**:
   - The first time you open the project, Unity will regenerate the `Library/` folder
   - This is normal and expected - the `Library/` folder is intentionally excluded from git
   - Import progress can be monitored in the Unity Editor's bottom status bar

4. **Build configuration**:
   - The project appears to be configured for WebGL builds (see `tank-wars/` folder)
   - AirConsole integration is included for controller support

## What's Included in Git

✅ **Included (tracked)**:
- `Assets/` - All game assets, scripts, scenes, prefabs, textures, audio, etc.
- `ProjectSettings/` - Unity project configuration
- `Packages/` - Package manifest files
- `*.meta` files - Unity's metadata (required for asset references)

❌ **Excluded (not tracked)**:
- `Library/` - Generated by Unity (can be regenerated)
- `Temp/` - Temporary build files
- `Logs/` - Unity log files
- `obj/` - Build artifacts
- `UserSettings/` - User-specific editor settings
- `*.csproj`, `*.sln` - Generated IDE project files

## Notes

- The `Library/` folder is excluded because it's large (~6GB) and can be regenerated
- When you clone and open the project, Unity will recreate this folder automatically
- The repository size is ~2.8GB due to binary assets (textures, audio, models, etc.)
- These binary assets are necessary to fully restore the project

## Dependencies

All Unity packages are defined in `Packages/manifest.json`. Unity will automatically restore these when you open the project.

## External Assets

The project includes external assets in `Assets/External Assets/`. These are included in the repository as they are part of the project.
