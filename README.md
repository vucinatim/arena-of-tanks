### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vucinatim/arena-of-tanks.git
   cd arena-of-tanks
   ```

   - Navigate to and select the cloned `arena-of-tanks` folder
   - Unity Hub should show "Unity 2021.3.24f1" next to the project
   - Click on the project to open it

4. **First-time setup** (automatic):
   - Unity will take **5-10 minutes** to:
     - Import all assets (~2.8GB)
     - Regenerate the `Library/` folder (~6GB)
     - Download and install packages from `Packages/manifest.json`
     - Compile C# scripts
   - **Do not interrupt this process!**
   - Progress is shown in the Unity Editor's bottom-right status bar

5. **Verify the project loaded correctly**:
   - Check the Project window - you should see the `Assets/` folder structure
   - Try opening a scene: `Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity` (or similar)
   - Press Play to test if the game runs

### Build Information
- **Platform**: WebGL (with AirConsole controller support)
- **Build Output**: `tank-wars/` folder contains WebGL build files

## What's Included in Git

✅ **Included (tracked)**:
- `Assets/` - All game assets, scripts, scenes, prefabs, textures, audio, etc.
- `ProjectSettings/` - Unity project configuration
- `Packages/` - Package manifest files
- `*.meta` files - Unity's metadata (required for asset references)

❌ **Excluded (not tracked)**:

- `Temp/` - Temporary build files
- `Logs/` - Unity log files
- `obj/` - Build artifacts
- `UserSettings/` - User-specific editor settings
- `*.csproj`, `*.sln` - Generated IDE project files

## Notes

- The `Library/` folder is excluded because it's large (~6GB) and can be regenerated
- When you clone and open the project, Unity will recreate this folder automatically
- The repository size is ~2.8GB due to binary assets (textures, audio, models, etc.)
- These binary assets are necessary to fully restore the project

## Dependencies

## External Assets

The project includes external assets in `Assets/External Assets/`. These are included in the repository as they are part of the project.
